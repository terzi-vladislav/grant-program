* An overview of the technology stack to be used:
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Electron Framework (desktop)
- React Native Framework (mobile)
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- Our application is a multi asset cross chain non-custodial crypto wallet, we support different protocols for blockchain connection, such as jsonRPC, WebSockets, GraphQL and other Web3-based solutions. We support different fiat providers and crypto-swap providers on our app as well, via REST API

### Ecosystem Fit

There are a lot of crypto wallets that support VeChain. Arctic Wallet wants to give the community possibility to have an All-in-One place with the most popular features of VeChain:

* NFT marketplace
* Staking
* Exchange
* Buy/sell
* Send/receive 

All of these features will be available in non-custodial wallets, so only the community has access to their funds + all necessary materials, tooltips to start using these features, even if they are not familiar with crypto yet.
